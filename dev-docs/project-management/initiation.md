## Business Case Analysis

### Strategic Business Objective
The strategic business objective of our startup is to revolutionize the
gaming industry by introducing an AI Game system that offers a highly
immersive and realistic gaming experience. Our goal is to develop
comfortable and modern AR glasses that enable players to interact with
virtual objects mapped to real-world surroundings. By creating a
multiplayer game with a story mode and interactive missions, we aim to
provide gamers with a unique and captivating gaming experience.

### Initial Project Business Requirements

Convert Detailed requirements to high level buinesss-related here.

### Budget Estimates and Financial Analysis

#### Cost Estimates
Software development (including design and development): \$55,000.

Hardware development (AR glasses): \$25,000

Debugging, quality assurance, and user testing: 20,000\$

#### Financial Analysis

1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**
Discount rate: 10% (assumed)

2. **Estimated Cash Inflows and Outflows**

| Cash Inflow | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Year 1      | \$30,000 |
| Year 2      | \$40,000 |
| Year 3      | \$50,000 |
| Year 4      | \$60,000 |
| Year 5      | \$70,000 |

| Cash Outflow | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Software development | \$55,000 |
| Hardware development | \$25,000 |
| Testing | \$20,000 |

3. **NPV & ROI**
   
> Assuming a 5-year project lifespan, the NPV calculation would be as
> follows:\
> The positive NPV indicates that the project is expected to generate a
> net profit of \$73,790.

The ROI for the project is approximately 73.79%.

4. **Payback Analysis**

| Cumulative Cash Inflow | Amount |
|------------------------|--------|
| Year 1 | **\$30,000** |
| Year 2 | **\$70,000** |
| Year 3 | **\$120,000** |
| Year 4 | **\$180,000** |
| Year 5 | **\$250,000** |

Based on the cumulative cash flows, the payback period for the project
is 3 years. This means that it will take approximately 3 years to
recover the initial investment of \$100,000.
