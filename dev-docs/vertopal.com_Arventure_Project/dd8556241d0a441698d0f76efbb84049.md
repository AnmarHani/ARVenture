        1.  ### **Strategic Business Objective**

The strategic business objective of our startup is to revolutionize the
gaming industry by introducing an AI Game system that offers a highly
immersive and realistic gaming experience. Our goal is to develop
comfortable and modern AR glasses that enable players to interact with
virtual objects mapped to real-world surroundings. By creating a
multiplayer game with a story mode and interactive missions, we aim to
provide gamers with a unique and captivating gaming experience.

### **Initial Software Engineering Requirements**
